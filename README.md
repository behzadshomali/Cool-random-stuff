# Cool Random Stuff!

This repository contains every random piece of code that I have found **Cool**! Moreover, it is the result of merging two of my public repositories known as *Cool* and *Algorithms*. Here, you'll find everything from simple multiline scripts to some well-known algorithms such as *Shunting yard* or *Huffman compression* algorithms.
